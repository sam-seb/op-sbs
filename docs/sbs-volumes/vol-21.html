                Hello. In Volume 19, someone started the SBS the way Miss Merry Christmas would start
               it. So I'd like to start it the way Mr. 4 would do it.

                Hyello. Listen, there's something I've been thinking hard about. Whenever you begin
               the SBS Corner, you usually say "Start the SBS", right? That's so boring. SO... I
               thought up THIS! "ESSUUUUUU!" What do you think? It's a rip-off of "Ohhaaa" (ohayou,
               or good morning)! So use it!

                Hey hey hey. No, no, no no no! No one will use an imitation like that! You need a...
               uh... a bit more originality! Right, everyone? "ESSUUUUUU!" (full-face smile).

                In the SBS from Volume 19, someone said "Draw all 6 crew members with your left hand",

                They don't show One Piece on TV where I live... How can we stand for such atrocities?
               Please (x2), I don't care if they're just re-runs or whatever, just have them broadcast
               here where I live! Though it's probably an impossible request...

                It shouldn't be impossible. I've received quite a lot of these letters for a while,
               but I can't do anything about it. After checking with the animation company, as of
               Dec. 4, 2001, One Piece is shown on 27 stations nationwide, and it's just started
               running in Taiwan. There are three prefectures in which it doesn't air, however: Aomori,
               Yamaguchi and Oita. But even in these areas, there are some people who say they can
               watch it. They must be people who live close enough to other prefectures to pick up
               the neighbouring prefectures' broadcast signals. Here's what you can try. One Piece
               is a program on the Fuji TV network, so write a letter saying "I want to see One Piece"
               to the Fuji station in your prefecture. If the station hears a large outcry, they
               may consider it. I know there's a lot of other anime you can't see unless you live
               near Tokyo. I grew up in Kyushu, so I know your pain. Damn. Tokyo's pretty mean, huh?!

                Oh I'm sure you can figure out what Apple Tea is, right? It's a type of tea. And
               orange pekoe is another kind of tea. It's true that all the members of the BW like
               different kinds of tea. Mr. 3 likes "Earl Grey", Miss Goldenweek likes "green tea",
               Mr.5 likes "gunpowder tea", and Miss Valentine likes "lemon tea", and so on. They
               drink it at a lot of different places. But Mr. 2 likes "takopa".

                Nice to meet you, Oda-sensei. I noticed something when I was re-reading the books.
               I'm talking about this person on the left in Volume 18, page 162, 2nd panel, and this
               person on the right in Volume 19, page 15, 5th panel. Are they the same person?

               <span class="speaker">O:</span>
                Yes. That's right. You're quite correct. If you look at the current "Rebellion",
               you'll see a lot of members of the "Sand-Sand Clan" in it. Well spotted. Sand-Sand
               Clan It's pretty easy to tell when they're lined up like this, right? Oh, and just
               to confuse you a little, most of the people in the Rebellion call Koza "Koza-san",
               but sometimes you hear "Koza" or "Leader". Those people were probably former Sand-Sand
               Clan members.

                Oda-sensei! I was astonished when I read Volume 19! Because in the first panel of
               page 104, Sam is among the people running about! Why is he in Alabasta? Why is he
               drunk again? Tell me!!

                Oooh. I was surprised, too. I totally forgot I had drawn him. That's him all right,
               it certainly is. Chapter 171, page 104. Why is he there? Listen up... Today was his
               second daughter's wedding. Sam's wife left him to raise all of their daughters the
               summer his eldest turned 8. His second daughter was a delinquent. Quite the troublemaker...
               They fought often, and there were days when she ran away from home. Today, she is
               being married. Though he puts up a strong front by saying, "Finally I can rest easy
               now that you're gone!", he actually feels a little lonely but happy for his daughter.
               And so he said, "I can't stay sober tonight!" and he drank and drank and walked and
               drank, and before he knew it, he was in the middle of Alabasta. The people around
               him were making all kinds of noise so he started yelling too, though for a different
               reason than the other citizens.

                Ahem. I've been receiving a ton of questions about the anime so I'm going to tell
               you how much I'm involved in it, to either answer those questions or just to let you
               know.  
               </div>
            1. First of all, what I MUST tell you is that I am a manga artist so I don't make
            anime. What I can do is help out with the character designs for anime-original episodes.
            Nothing major. So basically, the One Piece world I've created in my manga is entrusted
            to others to be adapted in the anime. 2. And so, while on that topic, I want to introduce
            to you... "THE" UDA KOUNOSUKE! You'll see his name in every episode during the opening
            credits roll. He's listed as the "Series Director". That's basically "head director".
            Pretty cool, eh? "Head director". (DOOON!). 3. For the OP anime, there are 7 directors
            including Uda-san that take turns making episodes because you can't make a 30-minute
            episode in just one week. Every episode's director is listed at the end of the ending
            credits. And the person who organizes all of their work is, you guessed it, THE UDA
            KONOSUKE (whistle!). 4. If his opinions and mine do not meet, Luffy instantly ceases
            to be Luffy and the world becomes entirely different. Even if I create the most heart-wrenching
            moment in the manga, if the anime's "directing" is wrong, it becomes a forgettable
            scene. But the reason that doesn't happen, and in fact, becomes even more memorable
            in the anime, is thanks to Uda-san and his crew of Director-Fighters, for understanding
            the world of OP so well and their directing skills. 5. By "directing", I'm talking
            about music, sfx, voice acting and character expressions, so I'm truly grateful to
            all the people involved in the anime. Oh, by the way, my very own editor Habu-yan
            does the "scenario checking". 6. All in all, what I really wanted to point out were
            the credits that you audience probably ignore. There are a lot of hard working people
            on those credit rolls, and it'd be nice if you could become familiar with some of
            those names as well. 7. I know I made him sound very formal earlier, but Uda-san is
            really a cool, friendly man. Sometimes when I have a meeting with the anime staff,
            I go out and have lunch or dinner with Uda-san and the producers (they're fun, too).
            Usually though, I just leave the anime work up to them and enjoy it as a viewer, just
            like all of you do. I even cry sometimes. 8. And that concludes this SBS. See you
            next volume.
