            <div class="d"><span class="speaker">O:</span> I sure got a lot of these response... You wouldn't believe how many postcards I got
               about this. But you guys all understimated me... There's a proper reason for this.
               Under Mr. 3's body there just so happened to be a piece of "Unbelievably Floaty Wood".
               And that is why he was floating so unbelievably. Let's say, normally a person's floating
               power is 3 Pukas, and a sumo wrestler's would be about 5 Pukas. But on a good day,
               a piece of "Unbelievably Floaty Wood" can get as high as 13 Pukas, the world record
               set by floating master Pukayama Ukijirou.  </div>

               </div>
            <div class="d"><span class="speaker">O:</span> Yes. That is correct. Samuel Bellamy. That's him. They say he was a pretty big-time
               pirate in his day, and had a love for speaking. Instead of a "Hyena", he was more
               of a "Lion" fond of speeches.  </div>

               Oh, that's right. I have a question for you now. In Volume 21, Chapter 194 "Cut Through
               Steel", why is it that <span class="char" title="Zoro">Zoro</span> has his swords on his left hip in every single picture? And why is it that on page
               154, his scabbards seem to have disappeared entirely? Now, is it true that the mistakes
               in this chapter were so massive that even the readers failed to write in and scold
               me for them?  </div>Yes, it's true. Is it true that I didn't fix a single panel because of the half-assed
            reason, "there are too many panels to fix"? Yes, that is true. And now, a haiku: Hmmm,
            Oda-sensei. Looks tired again today. The weather is nice. Sensei, thank you very much

            <div class="d"><span class="speaker">O:</span> Oh. Well spotted. 400 years ago when Noland visited it, Vira was indeed just a merry
               town, but these days it's a violent and dangerous country in the midst of a coup d'�tat
               (rebellion). But it's not really so much what's happening in Vira, as what's happening
               all around the world at this time. I think you'll discover what I mean in the near
               future. Not as large as Arabasta, it's just a small country in the Grand Line. So
