               <span class="speaker">O:</span> What they did was use their heels to crack open a barrel of beer to celebrate their entrance into the Grand Line. You could call it a "One Piece-Style Sailing Ceremony". I wanted to draw some more about it, but I really wanted to call the 100th chapter "The Legend has Begun", so I was in a hurry to make ends meet. Pretty cool, huh? Now, about a real "sailing ceremony". Before they begin building the ship, there is a "building ceremony". Once the ship is fully built, there is a "completion ceremony". And when it finally goes to sea, there is a grand "sailing ceremony". In other words, the "sailing ceremony" is the biggest and most exciting celebration of the birth of a ship. To celebrate, you break a bottle of liquor on the bow of the ship, and if the bottle doesn't break, the ship is cursed with bad luck. It's a time of celebration, but the person who actually does the breaking has to take it seriously. I've even heard that in Viking "sailing ceremonies" they spilled blood on the ship from a live sacrifice. Yikes!  </div>[insert SBS15 2 Sailing Ceremony] Kaya: It's finished! → yah!</div>

Was that changed because of the young children watching the show?  </div>
            <div class="d">
               <span class="speaker">O:</span> Yes. The concept of eating your own leg in that part of the story would be too much of a shock for young children. When you consider that a medium such as television has tens of millions of viewers, it would be a terrible mistake to fail to adapt to guidelines. It's amazing that all those animators can continue to create such wonderful shows while still having to consider these issues all the time!! If you can feel their love when you watch the show, please send fan letters to Toei Animation. It'll cheer everyone up there.  </div>
