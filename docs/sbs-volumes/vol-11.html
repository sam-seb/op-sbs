                This time, I thought I'd take a break from the SBS Corner and answer the very frequent
               question, "What does the inside of 
               <div class="char" title="Luffy">Luffy's</div> ship look like?" What kind of a ship IS 
               <div class="char" title="Luffy">Luffy</div> and friends' Going Merry, anyway? Here's your answer!! [Insert entire Volume 11 Ship
               tour/explanation here]
