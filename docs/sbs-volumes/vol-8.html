               a threat to the enemy, but were hourglasses really used for that meaning? At that
               period in time?  </div>
            <div class="d"><span class="speaker">O:</span> There really were pirate flags with hourglasses on them. It basically indicated the
               time left until the death of their prey, so it holds a meaning like, "It's only a
               matter of time until your surrender".  </div>

            <div class="d"><span class="speaker">O:</span> To tell you the truth, it's impossible to measure. There are games at the arcade
               that measure your kick power? Well, if <span class="char" title="Sanji">Sanji</span> used one of those, he would destroy not only the game, but the wall of the entire
               building. But if you tried to put it into a form of measurement, I would say 21 bats.
               The power to destroy 21 wooden baseball bats in one kick.  </div>

               here's my question. Who are the "One Piece" characters with the highest and lowest
               IQ's?! Okay, that's enough for today.  </div>
            <div class="d"><span class="speaker">O:</span> I'll tell you. But when I say "in One Piece". I really mean, "of all the characters
               introduced so far in One Piece". And having cleared that up, the character with the
               highest IQ is <span class="char" title="Shanks">Shanks'</span> first mate, Benn Beckman. He is a great crewmate, who supports <span class="char" title="Shanks">Shanks</span> with his astonishing wisdom and strength. And right after him would probably be Captain
               Kuro, then <span class="char" title="Nami">Nami,</span> etc. Now as for the lowest IQ... I can't decide the worst one. They're all idiots.

            <div class="d"><span class="speaker">O:</span> Actually, it's a "kotatsu-buton". He's a cat, after all.  </div>(A kotatsu-buton is the futon that covers a kotatsu, which is a table with a heater
            underneath. The cover keeps the heat underneath, and cats are said to love hiding
            under the kotatsu where it's warm).</div>

            characters are Baka Tono (Stupid Lord) and Henna Ojisan. Baka Tono's signature pose
            is "Aiiiiiiin!" The sub-unit of Morning Musume, Mini Moni even did an entire song
            on it called "Ai~n! Dance Song")</div>

               of "One Piece". The base Koby is in is the 153rd Branch. Officers of Captain rank
               and above command the bases spread out all over the world. I wonder when the day Koby

            <div class="d"><span class="speaker">O:</span> It's not just pirates and rum, but sailors and rum. In short, rum is cheap. Because
               of that, back in the sailing days of England, the liquor they supplied the navy with
               changed from brandy to rum, and the hard-drinking men of the sea became associated
               with rum. As for why they would take so much liquor, it was because the water would
               go bad on longer voyages.  </div>

               Gomus?  </div>

               is 10 times as much as a "Gomu Gomu". So in other words, 7,050 Gomu Gomus!! That's
               an astronomical length!! But be careful. Gomu Gomuns are notorious for giving the
               most ridiculous answers in the universe.  </div>
