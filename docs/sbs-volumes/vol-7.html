               Devil Fruit for you", so I went ahead and ate it. Now it may just be my mind playing
               tricks on me, but I get the feeling that all the jokes I say aren't very funny.  </div>

               "Samu Samu no Mi". If you eat that fruit, nothing but bad jokes come out of your mouth.
               And to make matters worse, you can't swim. You really got the raw end of the deal
               there, my friend. Ha ha ha ha. Laugh it up, laugh it up. Ha ha ha.  </div>(Note: Samu(i) means 'cold', and is often used when someone says a bad joke. Kind
            of the same as when a comic says "tough audience".)</div>

            <div class="d"><span class="speaker">O:</span> That was the work of the carpenter "Minatomo-san". He has a short temper, so he cannot
               pass by a broken door or what-have-you without repairing it. I assure you, this wasn't
               my mistake.  </div>[Minatomo image goes here] (Text: "Don't joke around, punk!! Quit lookin' at me~").</div>

               not right. Patty is taken from the name of a type of dessert chef (patissiere). And
               Carne is taken directly from the Spanish word for meat.  </div>

               school, a tankōbon was 360 yen and a Jump cost 170 yen. But the price of everything
               rises. There's nothing I can do about it. It's the same for everyone. And 100 yen

               Outside of that distance, he cannot control those parts of his body.  </div>
