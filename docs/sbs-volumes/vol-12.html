               stuff? Please tell me. From the third of Koby's happy friends.  </div>

               "My school goes for eight periods", but I'm sure you can manage a workaround on that
               one. Sorry. It's hard to study for so long!  </div>

               if I mailed one on November 1, when does it fall into your hands? Please let me know.
               </div>
            <div class="d"><span class="speaker">O:</span> First of all, the letters everyone sends me are delivered to the "Weekly Shounen
               Jump Editorial Department". There, people working part-time separate the letters according
               to author, and my manager sends me my letters once a week. So if you're lucky, it
               might even be the day it arrives at the Editorial Department. It's almost always within
               a week or two, though.  </div>

               make the same face. Do you do the same thing when you draw one of <span class="char" title="Nami">Nami's</span> sexy faces? Do you make an "Ooh-la-la" face?  </div>
            <div class="d"><span class="speaker">O:</span> Of course. I'm famous with the local public for my sexy faces. They think I might
               be hotter than a magazine model queen.  </div>

               Anyway, I have a question. <span class="char" title="Buggy">"Buggy</span> the Clown" can split himself in pieces, right? Which means he can also do it DOWN
               THERE, if you catch my drift... I can't get any more specific! Don't make me say it!
