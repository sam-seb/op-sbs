            <div class="d"><span class="speaker">O:</span> Before I start the SBS, I'd like to introduce a letter that has come in to save me
               from a certain group that has been ruining this corner. I'm so happy.  </div>

         <div class="qna">
            <div class="d"><span class="speaker">D:</span> Hello. I have great news for Odacchi today. I'm taking a stand to protect Odacchi
               from the "SBS Hijacking Group" that has been obstructing his SBS Corner!!! I call
               myself Team Captain Richard of the "Advancement of the Destruction of the SBS Hijacking
               Group Team". Now to celebrate our first day of action: Ready, set, go!! Start the
               SBS!  </div>
            <div class="d"><span class="speaker">O:</span> Great, now you started it!!  </div>

         <div class="qna">
            <div class="d"><span class="speaker">D:</span> I've been thinking on a worthy topic for five years now. And that topic is, "Why
               is it that in battle manga, the bottom half of people's clothes never get ruined?!"
               </div>
            <div class="d"><span class="speaker">O:</span> If they fought naked, wouldn't it kind of change the emphasis of the manga?  </div>

         <div class="qna">
            <div class="d"><span class="speaker">D:</span> In regards of Tashigi-san, who appears in Volume 11 - On page 119, she acts quite
               near-sighted, but when she's looking at the katana on page 132, she put her glasses
               up on purpose, and on page 161, when she runs up late, she isn't wearing them at all.
               Are they just for show?  </div>[Insert image of Tashigi]
            <div class="d"><span class="speaker">O:</span> It's not really for show; it's because she's slightly short-sighted. She can see
               things close up, but when they get farther away, they start to get blurry. I think.
               Most likely.  </div>

            <div class="d"><span class="speaker">O:</span> Oooh, good idea. Me, the voice actor for Pandaman? Nice. Okay, I'll go talk to the
               people at Toei Animation about doing that... Wait, Pandaman doesn't have any lines.

            <div class="d"><span class="speaker">O:</span> A cat... that's a cat...? So, why did I create it? When I read manga graphic novels
               years ago, a lot of authors used to put this sort of thing in their books. Because
               I enjoyed them so much, I decided that if I was a manga artist, I would put them in
               my books. That's why I made it. You know... if that's supposed to be a cat...  </div>

            <div class="d"><span class="speaker">O:</span> That can't possibly be a cat... An octopus, maybe... Is it an octopus?  </div>
         </div>
         <div class="qna">
            <div class="d"><span class="speaker">D:</span> What are the "21 O-Wazamono" and "Wazamono" and all that stuff? Also, what does Yubashiri's
               "unravelled edge with a small T" mean?! Huh???? I'm totally lost.  </div>
            <div class="d"><span class="speaker">O:</span> Ahh, well. You don't really need to understand it, mainly it was just supposed to
               sound really cool and impressive. But for the curious, I'll give a little explanation
               about katanas here.- This is "Wado-Ichimonji"(1), which <span class="char" title="Zoro">Zoro</span> carries as a memento of Kuina. For this katana, the "level" is "O-Wazamono", the
               "make" is "White-Painted Scabbard Long Sword" (this is a type of outward appearance
               for swords. It means the scabbard is painted white), and the "blade" is a "straight
               edge". - For swords, the levels go down from Saijo-O-Wazamono, O-Wazamono, Ryo-Wazamono,
               Wazamono, and then normal swords. A Wazamonos means it's an excellent blade. When
               they say "12 Saijo-O-Wazamono", it means there are 12 blades in the world that are
               considered the very best.  </div>There are two types of blade edges: suguha or "straight edge"(2), and midareba or
            "unravelled edge"(3). These are types of patterns you can make on the blades when
            you forge them. But since unravelled edges come in various forms, they turn into an
            "unravelled edge with a ___". [Insert image of swords]</div>

            <div class="d"><span class="speaker">D:</span> Are those glasses that <span class="char" title="Usopp">Usopp</span> wears when he fights?  </div>
            <div class="d"><span class="speaker">O:</span> Those are goggles. "Sniper goggles". At first he only wore them for looks, but in
               Loguetown he got the brand new model from "North Blue". The scene on the right was
               supposed to be the first page of Chapter 98, in Volume 11. The number of pages went
               over the limit, so we scrapped it. The goggles have sunglasses on them to eliminate
               glare when aiming, and they can flip up and turn around and stuff like that, so <span class="char" title="Usopp">Usopp</span> really likes them.  </div>[Insert image of Usopp's Goggles. Text reads:] Usopp: Hmmmm? Hmmmm. Ooooooh. Damn!
            I like these goggles!! Lady: You got an eye for the good stuff. That's the newest
            model from "North Blue". It came with the Marines when their annual import ship came
            by. Usopp: I also want this watch, and this magnet! Oh, don't you have any raw eggs?!
            Lady: Go to the market for that!</div>
         <div class="qna">
            <div class="d"><span class="speaker">D:</span> Hello, Oda-sensei. This is confusing to me, so please answer clearly. Is the stuff
               that you draw on <span class="char" title="Sanji">Sanji-san's</span> chin a BEARD? Or is it just a SHADOW? If it's a beard, please make him shave it off.
