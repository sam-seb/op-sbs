                Salutations, Oda-sensei. This is my first ever letter, but I'm afraid to say I can't
               draw, I can't come up with any humorous questions, nor can I ever meer Master Brogy.
               So please, if you will. Please allow me to at least say the words that everyone longs
               to say... Ahem.  
               </div>
            START THE SBS! Hehehe... That felt great! P.S. I'm sure you get many such letters
            like these, but I assure you I'm serious.

               read my work.

               That BW guy that got cut down by Sergeant Major Tashigi in the "Ignition" chapter!!
               Does that say "I LOVE MISS VALENTINE" on his back?! Whoa!! I have a rival!!! Does
               that mean there's a Miss Valentine fan club or something?! Let me in if there is!!!

                Hohoh. Very quick to spot that, weren't you? "Ignition" is chapter 206, so you spotted
               it on the very first page on the very first chapter of this volume. Now that's a dedicated
               fan. BW has over 2000 members in it, so you find all sorts. As there are guys who
               feel like rivals to the Number Agents, there are also guys that idolize them. There
               are fan clubs, too. If you want to join, send your name, address and age to the Whisky
               Peak AFC (Agent Fan Club)... Oh wait,

                Apparently they just took a trip to the Hokkaido Winter Festival. But since it'd
               be bad for each agent to know who the other agents are, they all received their trip
               train tickets separately and went on vacation individually.

                No, she... how should I say this? She's kind of like a hypnotist. Colors can already
               affect humans subconsciously such as exciting or calming us down. So she's a painter
               who can further enhance these effects, not a Devil Fruit user.

                In the Cover Page Stories, there are "Camie the Mermaid" and "Octopako the Fishwoman".
               How are the races of mermaids and fish(wo)men related?

               <span class="speaker">O:</span>
                As you can see here, the ones with the bottom half of fish are "mermaids". The ones
               with fish-like upper halves are "Fish-Men". To illustrate the difference with an octopus,
               look to the right. As for the difference in their natures, mermaids generally try
               to be friends with other fish, while the Fish-Men try to rule the fish. That's the
               gist of it. Of course, their habitats are different too, but you'll see for yourself
               later on in the story eventually.

               4th mystery is, "The 5th mystery is a mystery". So... hahaha! It's a bundle of mysteries!

                Hmmm. I've been getting a fair amount of questions regarding foreign versions of
               the manga, so I think sometime in the future I'll make a little page explaining stuff
               like that. Just give me a little time. It's being published in a lot of different
               countries, you know. One Piece, that is.

                You know how if you start calling a friend by a funny nickname, you can't really
               go back? It's the same case here. In fact, if she were to suddenly start calling him
               
               <div class="char" title="Zoro">Zoro-san,</div> it would seem strange. I think

               that's been bothering for quuuuuuuiiiiiite a while now. What kind of alcohol is the
               one that Doctorine is always drinking? In the manga, the bottle's labeled "UME" but
               is it ume as in plum???

                Oh come on now, Odacchi. You don't even know what the "ran" in gakuran means?? Then
               I'll explain, just for you! The "ran" in gakuran comes from the esoteric Edo-period
               term for western clothes, "randa". How about that? Cool, huh? It's not ranpaku (egg
               white).
