               to do with age?  </div>

               it'll be good if Smoker's birthday is March 14 (White Day), and Hina's is March 3
               (Hinamatsuri). Tschï¿½s.  </div>
            <div class="d"><span class="speaker">O:</span> Er. I introduced both of them at the same time. Birthday? Yeah, ok. Smoker's 34 and
               Hina's 32. They got into the Marines at the same time, but Hina was, of course, an
               elite. Smoker was the punk that never listened to his superiors. You might want to
               say that they're stuck with each other. Smoker almost gets fired, and Hina rescues
               him. But anyway, they both ate the Devil Fruit, so they're pretty important forces
               for the Marines, and one of the reasons why they're Captains at such young ages.

               of a bike is it?  </div>

               one of these days. Wonder when that'll be?  </div>

               that was a typo, but my mother told me that it means "let's have a feast", and I was
               convinced. Is it some kind of a dialect?  </div>
            <div class="d"><span class="speaker">O:</span> Mmm. This was actually a pretty popular question. I hoped people would kind of get
               it from the context. If I must put it in the simplest terms, it is a dialect. It's
               the "Edo-ben". Tokyo's old dialect. You've probably heard "te yandei!!". That means
               "Wha're you saying !!". Edo people had very little patience, so "yaraideka!" means
               "How could we NOT!" I heard this from one of my good friends who lives in the traditional
               area, so I don't think it's wrong. I've been thinking about having a "Edokko Pirates"
               (Edokko means "kids from Edo"). It'll be funny to do that. Someday.  </div>

               that does Karoo's voice is actually Hirata Hiroaki, who does <span class="char" title="Sanji">Sanji.</span> Is it true?!  </div>
            <div class="d"><span class="speaker">O:</span> "Kueee!!". Yes. That's Hirata-san aka <span class="char" title="Sanji">Sanji</span> doing it. And Matsuge from Alabasta's being done by Yamaguchi aka <span class="char" title="Usopp">Usopp.</span> In the anime, say, if <span class="char" title="Sanji">Sanji</span> or <span class="char" title="Zoro">Zoro</span> don't appear in the episode, then the regulars don't have lines. What they do when
               that happens is they play around. *laughs* Like guessing animal voices. But they don't
               use their real names in the credits, so they just use "Sokotsuya" ("Rude Guy") like
               that. But listen carefully to the animals. If the voice actor's name is "Sokotsuya",
               it's one of the Straw Hats doing it.  </div>
