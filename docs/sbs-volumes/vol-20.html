                HELLLOOOO to all you good little children reading the SBS Corner! Well, you sound
               enthusiastic. A nice friend of ours has come today. Here he is, "Eiichiro-kun". (applause)
               Thank you for coming. Why don't we have Eiichiro-kun announce the title of the Corner,
               okay? Go ahead.

                Pardon? Hmm... Oh I see. It's a letter from a One Piece fan in Taiwan. Well, since
               Japanese also uses Chinese characters, I think I can make out the meaning. It's PROBABLY
               asking this:

            "Why do all the crew members other than Nami wear only one outfit?" There is a reason
            for that, you know. First of all, they definitely have many changes of the same outfit.
            And also, Nami doesn't give them much allowance. Stuff like that.

               his "firepower" and turns his fist into a huge flame, so it ends up looking more like

                I see. So you had one of those quarrels, "Pen Name Nishi-chan". But never fear, damn
               you! It's okay, dammit! 'Cause besides, Shounen Weekly Jump is a boys' magazine with
               a 30% female readership, to tell you the truth. Basically, out of every 10 Jump readers,
               3 of them are girls. And that percentage carries over into One Piece readership as
               well. Just make some simple calculations and assume you have 1,200,000 friends around
               the country. If you understand the zeal of a young boy's soul, then of course, boys,
               girls, old guys and ladies can all bring it on! Come at us, dammit!

                Oda-sensei! There was a music question in my finals! And on the question was about
               "Bach". Apparently, historians label Bach as a "Baroque" artist... So maybe Igaram
               (who looks like Bach) + Baroque style = "Baroque Works!!" So... Am I right?

               <span class="speaker">O:</span>
                Yup. That's right. It's going to be extremely difficult for me to explain this one.
               Baroque was a style of art, literature and music prevalent in 17th century Europe.
               In my own very simple description, it was absurdly extravagant. Excessively ostentatious.
               Therefore, I made the Baroque Works a collection of characters that are each over-the-top
               in their own ways.

                This is a question from a Tokyo-area 28 year old male (working in the manga editor
               field). I would like to know the names of all the Super Spot-Billed Duck Troops members.
               Oda-sensei, I simply MUST know. T-they're so cute... I know this must be very hard
               for you, but please... do it for me.

                Hey! Hey!! Hold on just a dang tootin' minute. I know who you are. You're that former
               One Piece editor with a weakness for cute things, working for a certain Jump editorial
               department, Da-asa or Asada or whatever, right?! You, sir, are relentless. And now
               you're sending business questions to the SBS via email?! This is supposed to be sacred
               ground for my readers... ah, well. Oh but, thanks for helping me out for those 4 years.
               In any case, since OTHER people have asked this too, I'll answer it. The bottom row,
               starting from the left, is Cowboy, Bourbon Jr., Karoo, Kentauros, and Hikoichi. The
               top row is Stomp and Ivan X . That's all. I had the names all established, but putting
               them all in the manga would be too hard to figure out, so I decided not to.

               their nose? The other mangakas just have their cameras pointed away when it happens.
               If you don't pick your nose... your boogers would collect up!! Oh dear... another
               dirty topic. Printing this kind of stuff makes all the female readers cringe. It'll

                To Oda-sensei. Hello! I simply must ask you a very serious question. On page 94 of
               One Piece Vol. 18, the "Spiders Cafe" looks an awful lot like the "Bagdad Cafe", directed
               by Percy Adlon. Did you use that as inspiration? I really like that movie, so please
               tell me if it's true.

                Wow, I'm impressed. 15 years old and you like that movie? That's right. I just loved
               the atmosphere of that movie so much. But that kind of refined coolness is so out
               of place in a shounen manga, I was really the only one who knew what it was from.
               Anyone with good taste should watch it. It'll stick in your heart. "Baghdad Cafe".
