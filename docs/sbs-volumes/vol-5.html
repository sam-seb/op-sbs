                Hello. I might as well start the SBS corner now. Stand! Be careful!! Okay, stay there!!

                I have an inquiry, Sensei. Doesn't the first mate on 
               <div class="char" title="Shanks">Shanks'</div> ship have a name? And also the meat guy.  
               </div>
            
            <div class="d">
               <span class="speaker">O:</span>
                Take your seat. Of course he has a name. At first he was "Shofukutei Nezumi", because
               his face kind of looks like a mouse. That's what 
               <div class="char" title="Usopp">Usopp</div> said. He was lying. His real name is "Benn Beckman". And the meat-eating fat guy's
               name is "Lucky Roux". There's really no need to remember something like that, but
               since I got asked enough, I might as well clear it up.  
               </div>

         <div class="qna">

               <span class="speaker">D:</span>
                I have a question. I always see the sound effect "donnnn" (ta-dah!) in One Piece,
               but why "donnnn"? I think "babinnnn" would work just as well.  
               </div>
            
            <div class="d">
               <span class="speaker">O:</span>
                No. No good. No good at all. I use "donnnn" when I draw scenes to give them that
               "donnnn" kind of feeling, so if I drew in "babinnnn" it would give the picture a "babinnnn"
               feeling. But, maybe in a gag scene or something. Like "ufunnnn" (giggle).  
               </div>
            That's different.

                Nice to meet you, Oda-sensei! I love the manga you draw, "Nep Ece"

                RRRRRRGH! DAMN!! ...I love it when boys and girls misread and omit the letters like
               that. Makes me wonder if anyone can read those weird letters. I'm sorry for making
               the "O" and "I" in the title logo pictures and not simple letters. It's correctly
               spelled "One Piece". Remember that if you have the time.

                It's a German word. It means "seagull". The pronunciation is kind of like "Mehve".
               He really is a sailor, isn't he?

                You know, with 
               <div class="char" title="Zoro">Zoro's</div> Three Sword Style, I don't think he'd be able to talk with the sword in his mouth...
               Could it be... ventriloquism?

                You don't seem to use much tone. Is there a reason?  
               </div>
            
            <div class="d">
               <span class="speaker">O:</span>
                Well, it takes forever to start affixing the tone. It takes a lot of time (and it's
               a pain in the--)... My policy is, if you can only do partial tone, it's better just
               to make it black and white. That's my policy.
