            <div class="d"><span class="speaker">O:</span> As announced in Volume 2, the SBS Corner is now created. I received a lot of letters,
               thanks to everyone that sent them. And now, I will give an answer to all of you reader's
               questions and comments.  </div>
         </div>
         <div class="qna">
            <div class="d"><span class="speaker">D:</span> How old are <span class="char" title="Luffy">Luffy,</span> <span class="char" title="Zoro">Zoro,</span> <span class="char" title="Nami">Nami,</span> and <span class="char" title="Shanks">Shanks?</span>  </div>
            <div class="d"><span class="speaker">O:</span> A lot of people mailed me with questions regarding age. Really a lot of people. I
               guess this must be the No.1 question that everyone always thinks of. Well I will answer
               it now! <span class="char" title="Luffy">Luffy</span> is currently 17 years old, <span class="char" title="Zoro">Zoro</span> 19, <span class="char" title="Nami">Nami</span> 18. Well, since we have no idea where <span class="char" title="Shanks">Shanks</span> is at this moment, I'll just answer how old he was supposed to be 10 years ago. In
               <span class="char" title="Luffy">Luffy's</span> village, he was 27 years old. As for <span class="char" title="Usopp">Usopp,</span> he's 17 years old just like <span class="char" title="Luffy">Luffy.</span>  </div>

            <div class="d"><span class="speaker">O:</span> Eh... Weirdos...? Now that you readers mention it, I finally noticed that they truly
               are weird. But, I guess it's because the fact that they're weird makes them more mysterious.
               Aren't they much cooler this way?  </div>

            <div class="d"><span class="speaker">O:</span> I place them all in my room. And I personally read all the letters and postcards
               that the readers send me. These letters give me the strength to work even harder.
               In other words, thanks to your mail, I can continue drawing as a mangaka. Thanks everybody!

            <div class="d"><span class="speaker">O:</span> That is correct! The name really was taken from the so called "Most Fierce &amp; Cruel
               Pirate François l'Olonnais of the Caribbean Sea". That name, "Morgan" and "Alvida"
               are all real names of real pirates.  </div>

               some kind of decoration, or a wig? I really want to know! But, if that's really his
               hair, then he sure has long hair...  </div>

               Gomu Gomu Pistol (or use <span class="char" title="Zoro">Zoro's</span> sword) to puncture himself. 3. Then there will be a big explosion killing everyone!
               This move should be called "Gomu Gomu Bomb"!  </div>

            <div class="d"><span class="speaker">O:</span> Names... Most of them were chosen because they sounded good for the characters. Also,
               some of them are based on real pirate names.  </div>

         <div class="qna">
            <div class="d"><span class="speaker">D:</span> How come <span class="char" title="Luffy">Luffy</span> never kills his enemies? Throughout "One Piece" manga so far, he didn't kill Mohji
               and Helmeppo, but Axe-arm Morgan was killed by <span class="char" title="Zoro">Zoro,</span> why is that?  </div>
            <div class="d"><span class="speaker">O:</span> Hmm! That's a very good question. First, I have to announce that Morgan is still
               alive. He's currently in jail, where he was placed by his former subordinates. Why
               doesn't <span class="char" title="Luffy">Luffy</span> kill his enemies? Because in that era, everyone uses their lives to fight for their
               dreams. For an enemy, when their dream has been shattered, it is the same as losing
               a fight, and as painful as death. I believe that, as pirates, killing or not killing
               is secondary to victory or defeat.  </div>

               or a mysterious outfit, and let everyone guess what or who it is. Also, I love to

               (aka Takei Hiroyuki) manga), and in "Ruroken" (Rurouni Kenshin) he also appeared as
               a traveller. All the "Mikio Itou" in all 3 mangas are indeed the same person. If you
               ask me who he is, all I can say is that he fought many battles along with his friend
               throughtout the desert, and his sharp shooting saved him and his friend many times.
               Soon in the future, he'll make an appearance in front of everyone.  </div>
