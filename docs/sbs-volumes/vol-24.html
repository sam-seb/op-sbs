            <div class="d"><span class="speaker">O:</span> Yeahhh. I think it was about... 4th grade or so. When I saw a kappa.  </div>
         </div>
         <div class="qna">
            <div class="d"><span class="speaker">D:</span> A question for Oda-sensei. In the Marines, there are some people who wear uniforms
               and some people who wear normal clothes. Is wearing regular clothes determined by
               rank, or is it all up to personal preference?  </div>
            <div class="d"><span class="speaker">O:</span> Well... A little from column A, a little from column B. How do I explain this...
               Basically, when you first join the Marines, you are given a basic Marine uniform and
               cap. This is a pretty proud moment that you'd want to call home and tell your parents
               about. Private First Class (Ittouhei) and everyone below must wear these. So Jango
               and Fullbody are actually breaking the rules. For ranks Corporal (Gochou) and above,
               you can choose other types of uniforms or wear your own personal clothes. However,
               discretion is advised so that you still look the part of a Marine. Now when you attain
               the rank of Warrant Officer (Juni), you earn the privilege of wearing "Justice" on
               your clothes. For ranks Major (Shousa) and above, the Justice coat and suit is the
               most common attire. (For more info regarding Marine ranks, consult Volume 8.)  </div>

            <div class="d"><span class="speaker">D:</span> Hello. Here's my question, Oda-sensei. Among all your characters, which one do you
               think of as "most similar to yourself"? (I'm thinking I'm a lot like <span class="char" title="Usopp">"Usopp"...)</span>  </div>
            <div class="d"><span class="speaker">O:</span> Hmm... Let's see. Clever mind. Cool and calm personality. Stand-out attire... Guess
               there's really only one character who fits that bill... RED-HAIR SHANKS... Huh? I
               can suddenly hear everyone shouting for some reason... Hahaha... AH! OWW!!! Please
               stop throwing things at me!! It really hurts!!  </div>
         </div>
         <div class="qna">
            <div class="d"><span class="speaker">D:</span> About the Alabastian Civil War. I know there were 300 thousand royalist soldiers
               and 700 thousand rebels, but then in Volume 20, Chaka mentions "2 million angry warriors".
               Where did those extra 1.3 million guys come from? (I wonder if it was people who didn't
               join at first, like Toto, but then changed their minds...)  </div>
            <div class="d"><span class="speaker">O:</span> That's correct. Alabasta is a country with roughly 10 million citizens. To make things
               simpler to understand, I left out a bunch of things, but there are lots of other towns
               and villages besides the ones that appeared in the story. Hearing "10 million" might
               make 2 million seem smaller, but that's still an armed uprising of 2 million people.
               It's a very serious situation. A major rebellion.  </div>

               I have something to report to you, Oda Eiichirou-sama. THE TOILET PAPER WAS BROWN!!!
               (and slighty orange-ish)  </div>
            <div class="d"><span class="speaker">O:</span> FOR REALS?! Damn. Then you can't see the poop on it!! Is that because England is
               the country of Earl Grey tea?! Is it supposed to represent Earl Grey tea?!  </div>

            <div class="d"><span class="speaker">D:</span> Oda-chan! How you doin'?! (Inoki-impression) Umm, I have a question. In One Piece
               Volume 18, chapter 157, <span class="char" title="Luffy">Luffy</span> complains about lack of food with spirally eyes... but right behind him are <span class="char" title="Nami">Nami</span> and her orange trees. Can't he just eat them? They're oranges...  </div>
            <div class="d"><span class="speaker">O:</span> Oranges... Yes, there are oranges...... However... To pick and take one bite is to
               taste instant death. Yes, instant death. Going a whole week without food is usually
               not enough to kill a human. So whether you bear through it for some greater purpose
               still remaining in your life, or pick an orange (death) and try your luck with the
               navigator's fury... That's a pretty big gamble... That being said, if her friends
               really were starving to death, I don't think she'd be cold enough to just let them
               die. *Brrr*  </div>

            <div class="d"><span class="speaker">O:</span> Ahh. An address. For a letter.  </div>... BUT I GOT YOUR LETTER. (DUN-DUN-DUUNNN!) Umm. There are two adresses you can use.
            You can use the address for the editors' offices as written in Jump Magazine, or the
            special mailbox for the SBS questions only. Either way, it all comes right to me so
            don't worry.</div>
