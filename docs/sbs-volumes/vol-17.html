            <div class="d"><span class="speaker">O:</span> Before I start the SBS, I present the CMC (Chotto Machigae Chatta, "A Little Mistake")
               Corner!! This is for anyone who bought the first printing of Volume 16. It said that
               <span class="char" title="Chopper">Chopper's</span> name was "Tony-Tony <span class="char" title="Chopper">Chopper",</span> but that was a mistake on my part. It's really supposed to be "Tony Tony <span class="char" title="Chopper">Chopper",</span> so please try to remember that as you read it. What?! You don't care?! Oh well, now
               that you mention it, it doesn't really change the name at all. And now, THE SBS...

            <div class="d"><span class="speaker">D:</span> Hello, Oda-sensei. It seems that lately, everyone wants to call out the title at
               random. Well, I'm one of them. But I'm sure you would like to say it as well. So why
               don't we split it halfway? Let's go! "START THE SB".  </div>
            <div class="d"><span class="speaker">O:</span> "S". Ah... HUUHHHH...?!!  </div>
         </div>
         <div class="qna">
            <div class="d"><span class="speaker">D:</span> WHERE IS THE OKAMA WAY? Is it my house?  </div>
            <div class="d"><span class="speaker">O:</span> Hmmm. Where? That's a difficult question... since it IS the "path of those who have
               opened their eyes". I THINK IT COULD EXIST ANYWHERE &lt;3.... AAAH!!  </div>
         </div>
         <div class="qna">
            <div class="d"><span class="speaker">D:</span> To Oda-sensei. The giants Dorry and Brogy's helmets look an awful lot like the Celts'
               horned helmets and the Verden-era (I forgot when) Swedish crested-helmets. Am I right?
               </div>
            <div class="d"><span class="speaker">O:</span> Yes you are. The giant "Warriors of Elbaph"s image came from my original love for
               those pirates of the north, the "Vikings". So you are correct.  </div>ALL HAIL THEIR VALOR!</div>

            <div class="d"><span class="speaker">D:</span> I have a question. Is Momoo a "Sea King"? One of my friends says "He's a Sea King!!",
               but I don't know...  </div>
            <div class="d"><span class="speaker">O:</span> Momoo? To be precise, Momoo is classified as a "Sea Beast". It's the same thing in
               "One Piece" as what we call sea-dwelling mammals in our world, like seals or whales.
               Therefore, simply think of "Sea Kings" as giant, non-mammalian animals living in the
               sea.  </div>
         </div>
         <div class="qna">
            <div class="d"><span class="speaker">D:</span> Does One Piece have an official home page?  </div>
            <div class="d"><span class="speaker">O:</span> Hmmm. Maybe, maybe not. Not specifically for One Piece, but there is a Jump page,
               and in there is a One Piece corner. The name of the webpage is "Pop Web Jump", so
               if you run a search for that, you should be able to find it.  </div>
         </div>
         <div class="qna">
            <div class="d"><span class="speaker">D:</span> Please listen to me, Oda-sensei. When I was standing around reading in a bookstore
               earlier, I realized something. I thought, is there some kind of connection between
               <span class="char" title="Vivi">Vivi-chan</span> and ancient Egypt? <span class="char" title="Vivi">Vivi-chan's</span> full name is Nefertari <span class="char" title="Vivi">Vivi,</span> and her father's name is Nefertari Cobra. In ancient Egypt, the name "Nefertari"
               meant "the most beautiful" or "the most wonderful", and therefore was often affixed
               to the portraits of queens and princesses. Also, Arabasta is a sand kingdom, and her
               father's name is Cobra. I'll be really happy if I got it right. If I am, please acknowledge
               me as a rival to Knowledgeable Himeko. By Maimai.  </div>
            <div class="d"><span class="speaker">O:</span> I see... Is that what it means? Nefertari, I mean. Nice. I most certainly used ancient
               Egypt as a model for Arabasta, so I just flipped through a book about Egypt and picked
               out names that sounded nice. I see... I picked out a good name (for a person). Okay!
               I'll acknowledge it! You are a rival to Knowledgeable Himeko!! I see...  </div>

         <div class="qna">
            <div class="d"><span class="speaker">D:</span> How is a volume of comics created? Like, where exactly does the "name" get decided,
               and everything? Please tell me.  </div>
            <div class="d"><span class="speaker">O:</span> The "name". Ah yes. I do the "Great Name Introduction" in these books sometimes.
               I'll give a full explanation of the order it goes in. The entire schedule we go through
               to get this book into your hands.  </div>Step one) Space Out Space out dejectedly. Step two) Meeting Talk to the people at
            Jump about what will be in the next chapter. Step three) Planning Think about what
            will actually go in the chapter. Step four) Name Write a "name" on a blank piece of
            paper. Step five) Show the Name Fax the name to the boss. If he doesn't like it, we
            fight, or I rename it. Step six) Master Copy Call the assistants over to my house,
            and we go nuts for 2 or 3 days. We draw the master copy. Step seven) Jump goes on
            Sale Jump goes on sale around the country. Step eight) Meeting Now I talk with the
            high-tech boss Y-san about the cover of the book and how to color it. Step nine) Make
            the Extras Draw the cover pages and make the SBS. Step ten) Book goes on Sale It's
            already complete a full month before it's available in stores. The end. So this is
            basically how it works. Well, this is my schedule, but all artists have their own
            pace. Just consider trying to draw before coming up with a name for your master copy
            is like manga artists' block.</div>

            <div class="d"><span class="speaker">D:</span> Hello, Oda-sensei. I am "Always Serious Aiko-chan!!" In Volume 15 you suggested that
               we write fan letters to Toei Animation. I would like to, but I don't know what the
               address is. Please Oda-sensei, tell us with your Heart and Spirit.  </div>
            <div class="d"><span class="speaker">O:</span> Okay. I've gotten a lot of postcards like this, so I got permission from Toei Animation.
               Here it is:  </div>(An image of the address) Please send fan letters to the One Piece animators at this
            address. Even a single postcard with a one line sentence from the viewers (In my case
            it would be readers) cheers them up and gives them great energy, really. Sometimes
            I get letters to the animators, but I wish that you would send those sentiments directly
            to the people who created it.</div>
         <div class="qna">
            <div class="d"><span class="speaker">D:</span> Um, it seems like whenever Dalton-san, the Captain of the Drum Civilian Defense Force,
               is asked a question, he says something extra after it that doesn't matter at all.
               Is it because he's a nice person?  </div>
            <div class="d"><span class="speaker">O:</span> He does certainly say some unnecessary things. But I bet it's because he's just a
               good guy. Oh, and he likes chestnuts, by the way.  </div>(Two images of two scenes from the manga, with the following text). Dalton: It's a
            lakeshore town further north of here. And also... skating is popular there. Dalton:
            There's no denying that she has skill. But she is a rather... strange old woman...
            She's almost 140 years old. Sanji: A... 140?!! And she's alive?! Dalton: Well... yes...
            she does like those dried plums.</div>
