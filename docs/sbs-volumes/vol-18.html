            <div class="d"><span class="speaker">O:</span> I'd like to take the time to make a little explanation for a certain group of my
               readers. In Volume 17, there was a character named Chessmarimo. He is a combination
               of the characters "Chess" and "Kuromarimo", and when he talks, it's supposed to sound
               like both of them speaking at the same time. In order to represent that in the manga,
               I stacked the letters on top of each other... But, oh how they came... A flood of
               complaints. From the mothers of small children. "This book is misprinted!!" They said
               that to the editors at the company. I'm extremely sorry. Please, mothers, accept it
               for what it is!! Just read the book instead. Chessmarimo is HILARIOUS, ISN'T HE?!!
               (completely unapologetic)  </div>

               me!!  </div>
            <div class="d"><span class="speaker">O:</span> Oh darn... I've been found out.  </div>[Insert image of SBS 18 Chopper] (Hen na Ojisan is another character that Shimura
            Ken portrays and that little movement Chopper did is similar to his dance. The other

               accidentally drew BUGGY -&gt; in my notebook! I have -&gt; "Accidentally Draw <span class="char" title="Buggy">Buggy"</span> disease!

            <div class="d"><span class="speaker">O:</span> Ahh, the flashback from Volume 3. The answer is, the South Pole. The Arctic is not
               a continent, it's just a mass of ice. Land is colder than water, so the Antarctic
               is correct. So <span class="char" title="Shanks">Shanks</span> was right. However, the South Pole is not the coldest place in the world.  </div>

               so Mr. 2 is the male part, and Bon Kurei (Bonkure, the end of the Bon festival.) is
               the female part, because he's an okama, right?  </div>
            <div class="d"><span class="speaker">O:</span> That's right. The female agents' names are, in order, the happiest events of the

               What happens if one forgets the "salute" (mountain-climbing manners)? We're so curious,
               we can't have any children!  </div>[insert image of Hiking_Bear]

               so PLEASE remember it. Hiking Bears are bears that love mountains. They simply cannot
               allow people with bad manners onto the mountain. The punishment is this: sitting in
               correct Japanese style for one hour. It's very difficult. The people who suffer this
               have severely cramped legs, and they all say the same thing. "Please kill me, now".
               But the bears will not allow it. But that's what they get for insult the beloved mountain...

               and "Krieg" (battle). German seems to show up a lot in One Piece. But do actual pirates
               have much to do with Germany?  </div>
            <div class="d"><span class="speaker">O:</span> Hmmm, probably not... In this case, I just chose words that "sounded" right to me.
               For the Krieg arc, "battle" was actually the main theme, so I chose a word about battle
               that would be easy to remember.  </div>

               I couldn't beat a gorilla. They are the mightiest of primates, after all. Oh, but
