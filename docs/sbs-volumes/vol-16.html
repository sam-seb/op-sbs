            <div class="d"><span class="speaker">D:</span> To Oda-sensei, and all you readers out there!! We're going to have today's SBS started
               by the wildly popular "Ishi-20" (MD-20)! All right, Isshi-20, go ahead!  </div>I: START THE OPERATION.
            <div class="d"><span class="speaker">O:</span> The operation?! Oh well, I guess I'll go ahead and start the...  </div>

         <div class="qna">
            <div class="d"><span class="speaker">D:</span> Odacchi! Have no fear, for today, yes, today is the day you will start the SBS! So,
               are you ready?! Huh? Odacchi? Oda-chaaaaan! Ahh! There he is! ODA-CHA...AAH...AAAH...AAAACH--START
               THE SBS!!--OOOOO! OH NO, I SAID IT!!  </div>
            <div class="d"><span class="speaker">O:</span> Sneezes don't sound like that!  </div>

         <div class="qna">
            <div class="d"><span class="speaker">D:</span> Oda-sensei! Good day! I have a quick question for you. Are the names "Kuina" (Rallidae)
               and "Tashigi" (Snipe) actually taken from the names of birds? Please tell us! By Bird
               Encyclopedia Checker.  </div>
            <div class="d"><span class="speaker">O:</span> That's right. More specifically, they are the names of birds that cannot fly. But
               just because they say a bird cannot fly, doesn't mean that it never will. After all,
               I saw a duck fly in an anime I watched when I was little, called "The Wonderful Adventures
               of Nils". By the way, Nojiko (Yellow Bunting) is a bird's name, too.  </div>

            <div class="d"><span class="speaker">D:</span> I couldn't help but notice something... On page 137 of Volume 15, the woman appears
               to have spring onions in her basket! Three of them! But the same lady later appears
               on page 162! Is it me, or does she have a bunch more of them? If she's got so many,
               does it mean they're having roasted onions for dinner? Or onion stew? Just tell me
               what she was going to cook!  </div>[insert image of Negikuma Maria] First Appearance Second Appearance
            <div class="d"><span class="speaker">O:</span> Whaaat?! I am shocked, people. I seriously jumped out of my seat when I read this
               postcard, and this wasn't the only one. To tell you the truth, when we were drawing
               the chapter, my staff said, "Look, the onions multiplied", and I laughed, "Whatever,
               nobody will notice", but clearly the readers are not be trifled with! Let's see, the
               woman's name is Negikuma Maria (Onion-Bear Maria), age 43, housewife, and today was
               her eldest son's birthday. She wanted to bake a delicious onion cake for her son,
               so she was running about the town, gathering up onions wherever she could. So the
               answer to your question is "Onion Cake". Word is, it's horrendous.  </div>

            <div class="d"><span class="speaker">D:</span> I read Volume 15... and in it, Dr. Kureha says not to forget about his sickness,
               but sickness is written additionally with furigana as "Happy". What does she mean?
               Please, tell me, Oda-shaaaaaaaan!! (Crying)  </div>
            <div class="d"><span class="speaker">O:</span> She's talking about how being sick reminds you of the happiness you take for granted
               when you're not sick.  </div>[insert image of Kureha] Kureha: Don't you forget about THAT sense of happiness just
            now!</div>

               find any. Everyone else is good at that.  </div>So here's my question. What should my question be about?
