            <div class="d"><span class="speaker">D:</span> Hello, Ei-chan. I think I'm in love with Miss Merry Christmas' way of shortening
               her comments to say things as quickly as possible. And so, I'd like to start this
               one like Miss Merry Christmas would. "S...!" (Start the SBS!!)  </div>

Please tell me their ages!  </div>
            <div class="d"><span class="speaker">O:</span> First, <span class="char" title="Vivi">Vivi</span> is 16. <span class="char" title="Chopper">Chopper</span> is a human reindeer, so as a human he would be 15. Yeah. That sounds about right.

            <div class="d"><span class="speaker">D:</span> I have a question, sensei. How old are Dorry and Brogy?  </div>
            <div class="d"><span class="speaker">O:</span> Ah, good question. First of all, giants live to be around 300 years old, but they
               mature as half as slow as humans. So they'd only be considered "adults" around 40.
               When Dorry and Brogy came to Little Garden and started fighting, they were 58 years
               old (29 in human years). And they've been fighting for 100 years, so they are 158.
               But they'll live to be 300, so they've still got a lot of fight in them left. They're
               just a little older than Dr. Kureha.  </div>

            <div class="d"><span class="speaker">D:</span> Hellllo! Aaah, my nose won't stop running. Aaah, it finally stopped. Oda-san, I've
               been wondering about something. Something about Blue-Nosed <span class="char" title="Chopper">Chopper.</span> What does the X-mark on his hat mean? Aaaah, my nose is running again.  </div>
            <div class="d"><span class="speaker">O:</span> Okay, then. So about your running nose... Whoops, not that. I mean about the X-mark
               on <span class="char" title="Chopper">Chopper's</span> hat. It's actually the same as that thing. You know, the cross mark you see in hospitals.
               It's just tilted diagonally. Oh, and I don't think many people noticed this, but Hiriluk's
               hair was also the same shape. The shape of a hospital cross.  </div>

               in the future, too. (I'm in 8th grade and worried about my future. Please respond!!)

            <div class="d"><span class="speaker">O:</span> Well, I dropped out after one year of college. Also, I've never had any sort of art
               or drawing lessons in my life. There's a lot of other mangaka who're like that. I'm
               going to give you a serious answer because it was a serious question: Relying on someone
               else, no matter what special school you went to, is the most dangerous thing you can

            fax machine if the accessory is attached. Black Den Den Mushi (different species):
            They do not grow as they age. They enjoy eavesdropping, but dislike communicating
            with others. Commonly used as listening devices, or "wiretaps".
