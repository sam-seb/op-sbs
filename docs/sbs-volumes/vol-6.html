                A while ago, a kid from around here asked me, "Where can I go to meet

                Hmmmm... It's hard to say where to go in order to meet him. I suppose if you just
               set off on a relaxing voyage you might find him. But

                A mushroom. Before he ever became a pirate, he was a "wandering dancer". But business
               wasn't so good, so all he did was sleep. Without even taking a bath. And eventually
               a striped mushroom grew from his chin. Since he was so hungry, he tried eating the
               cap of the mushroom, but it was disgusting! But he gulped it down anyways, and somehow
               became able to hypnotize people. Therefore, the striped thing on his chin is a "leftover
               mushroom".

                When an artist is drawing Chapter 10, for example, what chapter is being printed
               in the newest Weekly Jump?

                I see. I wondered about this myself, years ago. So I understand your curiosity. At
               this EXACT moment, Issue 46 of Jump is hitting the stands. It contains One Piece Chapter
               60, "Solution". But I have finished the drafts up through Chapter 63, "I Ain't Gonna
               Die". So a chapter comes out roughly 3 weeks after I finish it. But that's only my
               CURRENT schedule. The people doing these weekly serials aren't actually all the same.
               I could change if need be. There are various cases.

               Meters, well...You can't put it those terms, you see? 1 "Gomu Gomu" is about 10 "Fairy
               Tale Gomu Gomus". 1 "Fairy Tale Gomu Gomu" is about 10 "Funky Gomu Gomus", so 
               <div class="char" title="Luffy">Luffy's</div> arm can stretch about 7200 "Funky Gomu Gomus". Got it?

                When you read One Piece, some mysterious characters show up from time to time. Like,
               in One Piece Volume 5, p. 182, in the third panel, there's an odd guy in the back.
               Who is he? I'm so interested, I'm not brushing my teeth.

                Yes, there were. But it was considered bad luck to bring a woman on board a ship
               in those days, and so many of them disguised themselves as men. There were two woman
               pirates, Mary Read and Anne Bonny, who were said to have fought more bravely than
               any man. By the way, my character Alvida was based on a female pirate named Awilda
               (or Alvida) who formed a pirate crew comprised entirely of women.

               Also worth mentioning is Shinya Suzuki, who just had his debut published, and was
               an assistant for Rurouni Kenshin, as well as an occasional helper with One Piece.
