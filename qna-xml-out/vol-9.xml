            <say> To Oda-Sensei, I always(x2) have fun reading One Piece! By the way, in Volume 7 p. 18, third panel, the knife Sanji's holding appears to have some writing on it, but it's so small, I can't tell what it is. What's written on it? Please tell me!!

            <say> I'm not surprised you can't tell what it is. I drew it so you couldn't tell. However, you did well to find it. I'll fess up. It says "Hokuto no Ken" (Fist of the North Star). It was a really famous series in Jump from when I was in elementary school. Do you know it?

            <say> I decided, I wanna participate in the SBS Corner, too!! And this is what came out, so listen up. Do you like crap, Oda-sensei? The word pops up a lot, and it's drawn on Klahadore's clothes, so I figured... Personally, I love it.

            <say> When I read about Usopp's past, told in Merry's refined speech, I accidentally started "man-crying", even though I'm a girl. The tears ran down my cheeks and into my mouth. What do you think it tasted like?

            <say> I heard from somewhere that Sanji's afternoon snack is Castella (sponge cake). Is that true? (After all, "Sanji no Oyatsu wa Bunmeido")

            <say> Ah, I see.
</say>
         </d>
         <info>(This is a joke based on a Japanese commercial for Bunmeido Castella cake. The catchphrase means "Bunmeido is the 3 o'clock snack", but 3 o'clock is "Sanji" in Japanese, so it can also sound like "Sanji's snack is Bunmeido").</info>

            <say> I went to the barber and told him "A Spirit-of-the-Man's-Heart cut!!" Then he said, "Okay!!" and he shaved my head bald. Entirely the wrong look. Sensei, are there any requirements to become a Zoro? Tell me!! *Sob sob*.

            <say> They are "flintlock pistols". The flint is a spark-making stone, so you can think of it as one step better than the fuse of a matchlock.

            <say> Hello. I have wine in my house ,so I wondered, "What country is it from?" And when I looked on the back, I saw the words "dry, full body". It was a bit of surprise. But I was rather pleased. Is this the origin of Fullbody-san's (The Ironfist) name? It is, isn't it? If it isn't, I think my life might be over.
</say>
         </d>
         <d>
            <speaker>O</speaker>
            <say> It's not over! You are right! I really don't drink much wine, so I don't know a whole lot about it, but I learned that the strength of and heaviness of the taste is called "body"! Heavy wine a long fermentation time has a "full body", and as it gets lighter it goes to "medium body", and then "light body"! Thus my explanation of Lieutenant Fullbody's name is complete! Thank you very much!!

            <say> What?! Are you suggesting that he hid those weapons as his balls?! As Dandy Gin's golden balls?! You're going to make all the Gin fans very angry. Gin's a popular one, he is.

            <say> In an SBS in Volume 7, you said Sanji-san's age was 19, but after discussing with my friend, we arrived at the conclusion that this was a lie. How old is he, really?

            <say> Why did "Red Leg Zeff" eat his right leg? That's where his kick power lies, so couldn't he eat the left one instead?

         <d>
            <speaker>O</speaker>
            <say> BZZZZT. Wrong. The base of your kick strength is actually the "pivoting leg". For instance, if you were to try to  kick a ball with your right leg, what would happen if you didn't have a left leg? You couldn't kick it, right? Why don't you go ask your soccer-playing friends? The life of the kick is contained in the leg that supports your weight!!
